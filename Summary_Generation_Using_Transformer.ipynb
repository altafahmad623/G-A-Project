I will pass it on toVinoba.You should train the women who are staying there. Thereis only one department of our work which needs to be under-stood. It will be difficult to evaluate our strength if we do notstart the publicity work at home.Vinoba has gone deep. My assessment of his work from theshortcomings he could discern, can never be proved wrong. Weare all like castor-oil plants becoming important in the absence ofother trees. In comparison, in my opinion, your work is out-standing. Take it that it is the end of your work if you are satis-fied with it. However I am sure that such a thing will neverhappen.Vinoba's aim in staying here is that he can explain to usour shortcoming.Both the departments those of self-sustained khadi andcommercial khadi, are important for you. Commercial khadi,without self-sustained khadi will remain ineffective. The latterwill not satisfy the poor. How much of it can they wear? Theycan certainly produce more than that. If the poor do not wearit, then there is a fear that they will even cease to producecommercial khadi.It is possible that even if one has faith in prayer, one cannotsing well. In such cases it is all right if there are no bhajans andslokas. Ramdhun will certainly serve the purpose. The slokas shouldbe correctly articulated if they are recited. Otherwise their trans-lation should be read out. However, it should be dropped if it isfound to be dull. For singing bhajans it is necessary to havea good voice. If that is not available, bhajans should also bedropped. Everyone would know how to sing Ramadhun. Butthat also requires a little practice.Purbai will bring credit to herself if left alone. She will bea misfit in a group. It is unlikely that Gangabehn will leave Bocha-san. We do not have so many trained women, so for the time352SELF-SUSTAINED KHADI353being there is no other course for you but to manage your workalone.It is likely that the urinal which you have devised undergroundwill cause great damage one day, while it will serve both thepurposes if instead you make it on heaps of mud which can bethrown into the fields daily. Urine is a valuable manure andthe less we use it the greater is the harm done.Blessings fromBAPUFrom Gujarati: C.W. 9851. Courtesy: Narayan J. Sampat\"\"\""

LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL August 24, 1934 BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI, Since Kaka has resigned his place on the Board of Trustees of the Vidyapith, all of us have come to the decision that you should be the Chairman of the Board. We have already appoin ted you to the post. I did not remember what my legal posi tion was in the Vidyapith, so I enquired about it and was told that I had none, but that, morally speaking, they regarded me as its Chancellor and all the teachers had agreed among them selves that I should be permitted to intervene in its affairs whenever I wished to do so. But this is no way of running an organization. You are the only person who can be the legal chairman. I am satisfied with whatever moral position I have and have neither the desire nor the strength to shoulder greater responsibility than that. 1 Vide also the following item. 2 Vide also the preceding item. LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 361 Another decision which they have arrived at on my advice and subject to your approval is that Narahari should take over management of the Harijan Ashram and that as many teach ers from the Vidyapith as he may need should be made availa ble to him. The expenditure over Narahari and other teach ers from the Vidyapith who may be assigned to the Ashram should be met from the Vidyapith funds as long as they last. I am of the view that this burden should not be put on the Harijan Sevak Sangh for the present, in view of the policy of the Sangh that it should pay caste Hindus from its funds in as few cases as possible. The ideal is that 95 per cent of the receipts should go directly into the pockets of Harijans. If we wish to realize it, we should set an example with our own workers. The third decision we have takenand this also subject to your approvalis that the remaining teachers should, if they agree, spread out in villages for rural reconstruction work and for service in villages, and start work according to the scheme or plan which I have put forward. Narahari will explain it to you. If you do not approve of any item in it, exclude it unhesitatingly. Kakasaheb, Kishorelalbhai, Maganbhai, Soman and Narahari were present when these decisions were taken and they have agreed with them. About Narahari, I have discussed the idea with Thakkar Bapa also. The Harijan Ashram cannot be run on the best lines unless it gets the services of a person like him. I am sure that, if we run it well, we shall advance the cause of Harijans consi derably. Only then will the gift of the Satyagraha Ashram have been justified. Though I know, therefore, that we can take many other services from Narahari, I think this is the best use we can make of him at present, and he himself is interested in this work and is fully confident of being able to make a success of it. Please, therefore, let Narahari be sacrificed for the Harijan Ashram. Blessings from BAPU [From Gujarati] Bapuna Patro  2: Sardar Vallabhbhaine, pp. 1223 \n",

LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU WARDHA, December 19, 1935 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I wrote to you last week about the sudden breakdown in Bapu's health. 2 He is progressing well, but it will be some time before his blood pressure becomes normal again. He seems to have worked at high pressure all these months and Dr. Jivraj and Dr. Gilder who examined him two days ago are definitely of opinion that he must have a couple of months' rest. This he has agreed to do. For ten days now he has been in bed resting and sleeping, never reading or writing or dictating. But you will be surprised to know that he continued to do his reading on the commode even during these days! And he finished the 9th Part of your magnum opusâ€”which it really isâ€” this evening. And as soon as he finished it he called me to his bedside and asked me to send you his impressions. If he had been well he should have written himself or dictated something but he did not want to strain himself in the teeth of the doctors' advice and so told me in Gujarati in a minute or 1 The addressee had noticed several appliances in the American nature cure clinics but had found them much too expensive and complicated for India. 2 Vide footnote on p. 169. 172 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI two what he felt. What I say will, therefore, be in my language and not his. He said: It is needless to say that it is a brilliantly written book, and a great literary production. There are parts where I have my fundamental differences with you and which I would like to cri ticize, but I will not do so as it is scarcely necessary or useful. For when all is said and done it is a highly introspective narrative containing an expression of your innermost thoughts and convic tions. Even if you could be persuaded to moderate or soften that expression, I should not attempt it, as it would result in taking away from its naturalness, if not also its truthfulness. After all we are helpless actors in the mighty flow of events, we have to act according to our lights allowing or expecting the events to correct us where we err. There is just one thing where perhaps I might make a helpful suggestion. The attack on the Liberals seems to have been overdone. It seems to obtrude on the reader's at tention over and over again and sometimes mars the grace and beauty of the narrative. Not that there is any venom in any thing that you have said; far from it; but you should not be even unconsciously guilty of doing an injustice to them. What you have said about Sastri leaves that impression on me. These friends served the country in their time according to their lights, and whilst we may have our serious differences with them we do not exactly serve the cause of the country by publicly pillorying them. If you have not, therefore, already sent the book on to the publishers, you might alter these portions. . . . Yours affectionately, MAHADEV GandhiNehru Papers, 1935.

I have been writing so much today that the right hand feels tired and I am now writing with the left hand. The body must have lost some strength but I have no such feeling. The fast1 has not in the least led to an increase of weak ness. Fasting never does if one knows how to return to normal diet afterwards.

Having done this, bathe in cold water. The skin will probably clear up in three or four days. Then start taking milk or curd which is not sour along with fruit and uncooked bhaji. Among the different bhajis, fenugreek leaves, spinach, luni and lettuce are the best. I eat even the leaves and twigs of mustard. To pray to God for anything means to aspire for it intensely. God is both different and not different from us. He is different be cause He is perfect, and He is not different because we are a portion of Him. If a drop of water separated from the sea may not pray to the sea, to whom else may it pray? But does the sea have to do anything to answer the prayer? Prayer is the an guished cry of one who cannot bear separation. The embodied soul cannot help uttering such a cry. The key to the nation's progress both is and is not in our hands. We can help in its progress if we reduce ourselves to a cipher. It is in our hands to do that. But the progress itself is not in our hands, because our reducing ourselves to a cipher means leaving ourselves entirely in the hands of God who alone is the digit of unity. \"O Udho, the secret of karma is beyond human under standing\" is an absolute truth. We can know that there is a law of karma, but we do not know how it works. That is God's mercy. We do not know the laws of even an earthly king. How then can we know the laws of God who is Law personified? The appearance of victory in the early part of this struggle was an illusion, and the appearance of defeat also is nothing but an illusion. In the lexicon of one who has unshakable faith in the ultimate victory of truth, there is no such word as \"defeat\". Blessings from BAPU From a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 10366 \n",

In so far as it has gone, I can say that a capable worker did succeed once or twice in spinning over 8,000 yards in 4 hours. There never has yet been an output of 16,000 in eight hours at Wardha. No woman has worked at it for eight hours at a stretch here. My trial of it is still proceeding. I should like to try it for SIX 1 Jamnalal Bajaj's diary contains an entry under this date regarding the deputation and Gandhiji's assent to preside over the Hindi Sahitya Samme lan to be held at Indore in April 1935. 315 316 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI months before pronouncing an opinion on its average capacity. But if the examiners are satisfied on this point, absence of a con clusive opinion from me need not in any way delay or otherwise affect the examiners' award. (5) I am unable to subscribe to the opinion that the machine \"has fulfilled all the important and major conditions of the com petition\". I have up to now only applied myself to two conditions, viz., 1st and 4th. I do not regard the 1st condition as to handiness as a minor one. Indeed it is in my opinion the one unalterable condition. Without that condition, there would surely be no difficulty in produ cing a machine that would give more than 16,000 yards in 8 hours. Handiness has to be proved with reference to the crores of cottages scattered in 700,000 villages of India. Accepting Webster's defini tion of 'convenient', a mere look at the machine would convince one who has any knowledge of Indian cottages and conditions that the machine cannot be called handy in any shape or form. For an Indian cottage it is without doubt a cumbersome piece of machinery. As to conditions 5 and 6, I am wholly incompetent to pronounce an opinion. As to condition 2, it is yet too early for me to pronounce an opinion. I understand from Shri Kale as also from the members of the firm who were good enough to visit me that the machine is not capable of being reduced in size any further than it is already. I am quite satisfied that the machine cannot be accommodated in an Indian cottage of the average size. The firm's suggestion that cottages should be specially built in order to house the machine is too unpractical to need refutation. In my opinion, therefore, the machine does not satisfy what to me is one of the vital conditions of the prize. But it may not be considered as more than the evidence of a witness before the judges.

Since you were meeting me after a long time, I was eager to ask you a few ques tions and have a careful look at you. Of course you did well to go back to your place of work. But I was eager because on that day you had stayed on. I am unable to say anything about Aurobindobabu. If a man with a flabby body cannot have pure wisdom, what can one say of one who is slim? I can only say that my path has borne fruit for me. Let us not make ourselves judges of the whole 1 Narayan Moreshwar Khare 2 Vide p. 91. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK 113 world. We should admit that among the two hundred persons living under his wing there are several whose lives have undergone a great transformation through his influence. Everybody follows his own natural bent. It is not quite correct to say that in the West they do not recognize the necessity of purity in private life, nor is it correct to say that here everybody recognizes it. We ourselves not only recognize it, but go further and believe that the actions prompted by a reason not purified inwardly will not endure, however attractive they may appear. Such actions cannot be judged from their immediate results. It is true, of course, that actions which have no connection with morality do not require inward purity. A dissolute carpenter will be able to make a rightangled table. But a person lacking in purity will not be able to eradicate untouchability or turn the people to the spinningwheel, for both these tasks require qualities of the heart. In such activities calculations of time count for little. We should have no doubt at all that actions performed with sincere and truthful motives are bound to have certain results. If we do not have such faith, we shall never be able to adhere to moral principles. God is beyond the reach of human thought. The God, there fore, whom we worship is a creation of our imagination. Nobody has seen the real God. If anybody has seen Him, he has not been able to describe Him. It is difficult to say which Form of Him is dearest to me. The Form, however, which I worship is known as Truth. He both has a manifest form and has none. He manifests Himself in innumerable ways. How can imperfect man see perfect truth? I don't intend to write anything about the jewellery though I have already made a note of the point in my diary. The additional note which will appear after your letter will be for my information. Isn't that what you desire? I will use the khadi when it is received. Lilavati has arrived here from Rajkot. This time her health is excellent. She has gained weight, too, and seems to be quite happy. I intend to leave on the 31st and reach Wardha on the 2nd. Blessings from BAPU From a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 10373 618 \n",

I do not remember your having asked for my permission. I did not at all like Harilal's idea about watches.5 Dissuade him. If he goes in for it in spite of that, let him. 1 In Bapu's Letters to Mira, Mirabehn explains: \"On my return from Europe, I joined Bapu at Wardha Ashram. Not long after, Bapu took up residence at Maganwadi, where the Village Industries Association was then taking root. I had remained on there when Bapu wrote the . . . letter . . .\" 2 The source has \"22\" which is obviously a slip.

The Ashram does not owe him anything. If you feel inclined, we may send him railway fare for coming; I don't. If he is very eager to come, he will, I am writing to him and informing him that if he does not come in a few days, time he will not be taken up. Titus has not gone on leave. He has left altogether. He was paid railway fare for the journey. I had agreed to keep him at Wardha, but he did not seem very eager. However, he will reply from Travancore. I have refused to give him a note of recommendation on anybody else. For the present draw the amount for Tharparkar from the Ashram account. Afterwards if necessary I will pay it from some other account. In my view Chimanlal1 is spending too much. But since we have tolerated similar expenditure by others, we should tolerate it in his case too. To a certain extent the desire to recover and to live on clings in all of us. Each one fixes his own limit of expenditure. Chimanlal is satisfied merely with staying in Veraval and having Talwalkar's2 injection. But we have spent over others much more than that. I, therefore, do not feel like imposing exces sive restrictions on senior workers. We should be satisfied with whatever selfrestraint he exercises. Do you have anything else to suggest in this matter? I see that we shall not get interest. It seems that giving money to Gajanan was a mistake. He had even given up study. The payment to Dhiru also should stop. He will have a copy of the agreement he gave in writing. It may be with Chhaganlal. Look into the matter. Was my suggestion to Lilavati all right? I am writing separately to Father3. Prema came and saw me. She handed over some of her jewel lery. We couldn't have any talk. If you have preserved her last two letters, send them to Gomati to read.

            "29. LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI October 11, 1935 CHI. CHHAGANLAL, I got your letter. Encouraged by you, I am pressing Jivanlal bhai. I am sending your letter to him. I will write to you after I receive his reply. If Pranjivan Joshi has already been relieved I will not waste time in inquiring into the matter now. Let me know the result of your experiments in making manure out of bones and carcasses. You shouldn't have had the difficulty which you had regar ding the use of handmade paper. The argument has often been advanced against the use of khadi and we have solved the difficulty in but one way. Though khadi is relatively costly, those who have understood its importance have found a way of making it cheap for themselves. Many of us, for instance, reduced the consumption of cloth after they started using costly khadi and on the whole effected some saving. Those who could not reduce consumption saved on other items but did not accept defeat. Similarly, when we resolved to use handmade paper, we reduced writing or included more matter in a given amount of space than previously. We stopped using envelopes costing four or five pice and started using postcards costing three pice only. I resumed here the practice of writing on small slips of paper, which I used to follow in jail. On the balance, therefore, our expenditure on postage has not increased. I do not know how things are in Delhi. But I hope Malkani has started practising economy. What we give to the Government is in fact given to ourselves. It is, therefore, not right to think that we should spend less on postage because the money goes to the Government. Even when the Government will be in our hands, it will certainly not be proper for public workers to spend extra vagantly on postage. In jail, we tried to keep the consump tion of everything to a minimum because we thought that all things in the country belonged to us. For, no matter who ran the Government, everything it owned belonged to us, the people. The 20 LETTER TO BALIBEHN M. ADALAJA 21 money that we give to the Government is spent for Government purposes. Because the Government money is spent extravagantly when the Government is in foreign hands, it does not mean that such money ceases to be ours. It is our duty of course to check its extravagance. But so long as it continues, it is we, the people, who provide the money in one way or another. Hence the argu ment of increase in postage should not be advanced against the use of handmade paper. In propagating the use of such paper, the expenditure on postage may perhaps go up in the beginning. Even then, if the use of handmade paper is likely to increase through our example we ought not to grudge the additional expense on postage. Those teachers who see the moral necessity of manual work will themselves find out some crafts which they can take up. Nobody else can advise them in this matter.

All this of course apart from what Mahadev and Chandra shanker may be writing to you. Your work in connection with Jawaharlal's release was prompt and glorious. As you very pro perly say, it was more humanitarian than political. I am glad, too, that the authorities rose to the occasion and lost not a minute in granting adequate relief. At this end, too, our machinery was set in motion. The whole thing ended so well. This release of Jawaharlal stands out prominently as the one bright spot on the black and mournful surface. I know you do not want thanks. You may have them by the trainload if you want them. I know this, that it would have been a severe disappoint ment to me if you had not acted as you did. You have accustomed me to look for such prompt and decisive action on your part. Do please, however, thank all those who helped you and made your difficult mission so completely successful.

There can be no doubt that, if we really ever succeed in disturbing God's plans and if God has any plans, these efforts resulting in Jawaharlal's reaching there have pro longed Kamala's life. I am oldfashioned enough to believe that not a blade of grass moves but by His will. Then, too, I can derive ample satisfaction in the knowledge that you and other friends conspired to fulfil God's purpose and therefore whilst you were doing your duty angels above were saying, 'well done, well, done'. Ghanshyamdas had to leave this morning abruptly, for he received a telegram yesterday that his mother was suffering from fever. He would otherwise have stayed here at least four days longer. He was able, however, to give me a fair summary of his doings there. Charlie must have told you all about the situation here. I can add nothing to what he must have said. I hope he benefited by the voyage. He needed rest badly. I wish so much that he would abide by the plans made here, namely, that he would live in Cambridge or some such place and busy himself in writing work of a permanent nature, holding himself at your dis posal when there might be something on which he alone could throw light or give guidance. I hope that you would encourage this plan. I know what a weak spot he has for you. Therefore you can always successfully act as the temptress if you chose. I must stop now. Love.

            "596. LETTER TO BISWANATH September 14, 1935 MY DEAR BISWANATH, Neither Baba1 nor Ma 2 should have suppressed you. You have a perfect right to write to me as you have now at last done. You have a double claim upon me. First because you are in an orga nization of which I am the head and secondly because you are connected with two persons 3 who have for many years accepted my word as law. In writing your letter, therefore, you have not only recognized your unadulterated right but you have also per formed the duty which you owe to me. That you have grievously erred in your writing does not in any shape or form diminish the value of your letter. On the contrary, the value is enhanced in that you have dared to tell me what you hold to be unadulterated truth although it may appear bitter to me and although I may consider it to be the reverse of truth. Very often we mount to truth by wading through errors so long [as] they do not appear to us to be errors. Your attachment as distinguished from affection for khadi has led you into a maze of errors. AllIndia Spinners' Association is the head and the associations affiliated to it are the branches. The head has rights which branches do not and cannot possess. What appeared to me at one time a sound policy under given circumstances may prove unsound under altered circumstan ces or on a fuller perception of even same circumstances. I would be an unworthy head of an organization if I sacrificed its interests for a seeming consistency. Again the liberties that Baba and Ma have allowed me to take with them and their creation I may not take with others. I would never be afraid of being misunderstood by them. Everyone of my actions in connection with Pratishthan, therefore, you have to interpret in the light of my relationship with Baba and Ma. It is a relationship of their creation. So much for the Pratishthan. Now for my new experiment. Since you admit that I am the creator of the khadi movement I must have the right to regulate its growth and even to destroy it. He who creates 1,2&3 Satis Chandra Das Gupta and his wife Hemprabha Das Gupta 419 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI can also recreate. And if I found that I made a mistake in fashioning my creation I must have the right to refashion it in any manner I like so long as I carry with me my associates in nursing the creation. You would admit that I would be a traitor to my own creation if for fear of the judgment of fellowworkers like you I fail to act up to my own judgment if it abide in spite of the criticisms of fellowworkers. I think this covers all the points that you have raised. You may write to me as often as you like till I have convinced you or till you despair of my ever succeeding in convincing you. Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI [PS.] I shall regard your letter as purely personal as desired by you. SJT. BISWANATH KHADI PRATISHTHAN SODEPUR, NEAR CALCUTTA From a photostat: G.N. 2729 \n"
